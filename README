This project was tested on Ubuntu 12.04

FILE MANITEST:

*C files:
  - readMatrices.c - A program that reads matrix data from user input and
      sends it to shared memory.
  - multiplyMatrices.c - A program that reads data from shared memory and 
      uses it to produce a product matrix using multithreading. It sends 
      the results to shared memory.
  - displayProduct.c - A program that reads from shared memory to display
      the product matrix results.

*Other files:
  - keyFile - Just a file for the ftok function call.

HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN:
To compile readMatrices.c: gcc readMatrices.c -o readMatrices
To compile multiplyMatrices.c: gcc -pthread multiplyMatrice.c -o multiplyMatrices.c
To compile displayProduct: gcc displayProduct.c -o displayProduct

However, the folder contains the compiled binary already, so this step
may not be necessary.

In order to run, you must run readMatrices first: $ ./readMatrices
Follow the program's instructions for user input.
Then: $ ./multiplyMatrices (to run the multiplier)
Finally: $ ./displayProduct (to view the results)

ISSUES?
No known issues.
